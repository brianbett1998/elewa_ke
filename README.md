## Getting Started with Elewa-ke-inest project
Welcome to the world of React development with Create React App (CRA)! This project aims to guide you through the setup and help you get started on your React journey.

## What is Create React App?
Create React App is a toolchain for building React applications with no build configuration. It sets up your development environment so you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a fast development server, and optimizes your app for production. It's a fantastic choice for getting started quickly.

## Technologies used
* React
* TypeScript
* CSS - for stling
* HTML - for markup

## Available Scripts
In your project directory, you can run several handy scripts to streamline your development process:

* npm start
This script launches your app in the development mode. It opens your app at http://localhost:3000, allowing you to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload whenever you make edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

* npm test
The npm test command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. It's an essential tool for testing your React components and ensuring your code is robust and error-free.

* npm run build
The npm run build script compiles your app for production. It generates optimized and minified files in the build folder. Your app is now ready to be deployed to production. The build filenames include hashes for cache-busting.

* npm run eject
Note: Be careful with this one!

The npm run eject command is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back. It's a powerful tool to take full control of your project's configuration. It copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project, so you have full control over them.

But remember, you don't have to ever use eject. Create React App provides an excellent set of features suitable for small to medium deployments. You can customize it when you're ready, but it's not mandatory.

## Learn More
To delve deeper into Create React App, check out the Create React App documentation. It's packed with valuable insights, tips, and advanced configurations to help you master React development.

To get started with React itself, explore the React documentation. It's a treasure trove of knowledge on building fantastic user interfaces.
